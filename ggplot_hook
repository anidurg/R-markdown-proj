## Setting up my environment

Notes: setting up my environment by adding ‘tidyverse’ and ‘palmer penguins’ packages

```{r loading packages}
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(ggplot2)
library(palmerpenguins)
```
Here we will go through a series of visualizations:

### plotting flipper length against body mass:

```{r plot with color purple on species}
ggplot(data = penguins,aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(color="purple") +
  labs(title="Flipper and body mass in purple")
```

### plotting flipper length against body mass by species:

Here we plot by species:

```{r flipper by species}
ggplot(data = penguins,aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(shape=species)) +
  labs(title="Flipper and body mass by species")
```

### Flipper and body mass by species and sex

Here we plot flipper length against body mass and look at the breakdown by species and sex:

```{r plot by species and sex with color blue}
ggplot(data = penguins,aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)) + 
  geom_point(aes(color=species,shape=species)) +
  labs(title="Flipper and body mass with shape,color, and sex") +
  facet_wrap(~sex)
```
